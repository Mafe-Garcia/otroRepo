# Exercise 4:

In this exercise we see various options for printing float numbers in just 4 bytes.

This is done by converting them to hex.

The first two options are said to be one kind of endian while the last one is the opposite

I personally don't really know which is which, how do I know what the heaviest byte is?

I think the first ones are big endian and the last one is little endian, but I'm not sure 

I used [this website](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/big-endian-vs-little-endian#:~:text=Big%2Dendian%20and%20little%2Dendian%20are%20the%20two%20main%20ways,at%20the%20smallest%20memory%20location.) to learn a little more about it
