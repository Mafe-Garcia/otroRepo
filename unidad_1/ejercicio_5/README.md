# Most important elements in Raspberry Pi Pico documentation:

## [Arduino API](https://www.arduino.cc/)

I would've liked that we had more of a route or guide in this site, upon opening the link i wasn't too sure about what to read, what could be helpful or what could be useless for what i needed.

I ended up reading about getting started with arduino, it mostly links to more guides, the most useful thing there is the care for the board, mentioning not getting food or liquids on it, and how to keep it clean and what to use.
